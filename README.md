## About the repo

### Why
- The purpose of this repo is to record the production of our mock agency website
- It is an opportunity for us to practice working collaboratively and become more comfortable using github, for example, github workflow and github projects

### What
- This repo stores the progress of our agency website project
- It provides access to the website for potential visitors
- It enables us to review eachothers work and merge asynchronous work

### How
- Github [issues](https://github.com/fac27/agency-website/issues) allow us to communicate asynchronously and track our progress
- 

## What are the fundamental aims of our agency website?

Our website should give potential clients:

- [x] An introduction to our agency
- [x] Information about each member of our team
- [ ] A way to get in touch if they are interested in working with us

## User story

- [x] Navigation menu
- [x] ‘About us’ section
- [ ] Contact form
- [ ] A user cannot submit a form without filling out all of the mandatory fields (name, company name, email address)
- [ ] Information from the form doesn’t get submitted until the user clicks a button

## Spike 

### Accessibility

- Semantic HTML provides easy web access for ALL users and improves readability for other coders 

### CSS architecture 

- CSS naming conventions are useful for collaborative projects so that other coders can access the code
- Specificity might become an issue during collaboration if names are illogical to other readers

### CSS layout

- Different display values determine the visual behaviour of the elements on the page

### Responsive design

- Responsive design adapts the web page according to the size of the screen

HTML Forms 
- [ ] Use the appropriate input types in HTML forms for gathering different types of information
